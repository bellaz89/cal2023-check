# Scripts to verify the paper 'Calibration of superconducting radio-frequency cavity forward and reflected channels based on stored energy dynamics'

## Before starting

Make sure the following packages are installed:

- python3
- numpy
- scipy

If you want to regenerate the simulation data, make sure to have *Matlab* installed.

## test1

This test verifies if Andrea's implementation of [1] with $k_{add} = 1$  Matches Sven's implementation.

## test2

This test verifies if Andrea's implementation of [1] with $k_{add} = 2.69595*e^{j\frac{118.7687 \pi}{180}}$  Matches Sven's implementation.
